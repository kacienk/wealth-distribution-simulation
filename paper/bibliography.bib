	abstract = {Agent-based social simulation (ABSS) as a main computational approach to social simulation has attracted increasing attention in the field of social computing. With the development of computer and information technologies, many new ABSS approaches have been proposed with wide application.. In this paper, we aim at reviewing research and applications of agent-based social simulation and modeling in recent years from a social computing perspective. We identify the underlying social theories for ABSS, its simulation and modeling techniques, and computational frameworks from both individual agent and multi-agent system perspective. We finally address some future research issues in agent-based social simulation and modeling.},

We then discuss the role of ABSS and how it may aid cross-fertilisation between these areas.},

	abstract = {Multi Agent Based Simulation (MABS) has been used mostly in purely social contexts. However, compared to other approaches, e.g., traditional discrete event simulation, object-oriented simulation and dynamic micro simulation, MABS has a number of interesting properties which makes it useful also for other domains. For instance, it supports structure preserving modeling of the simulated reality, simulation of pro-active behavior, parallel computations, and very dynamic simulation scenarios. It is argued that MABS is a useful technique for simulating scenarios also in more technical domains. In particular, this hold for the simulation of technical systems that are distributed and involve complex interaction between humans and machines. To illustrate the advantages of MABS, an application concerning the monitoring and control of intelligent buildings is described.},

We look at the following problematic areas: (i) interpretation of the simulation dynamics and generalization of the results, and (ii) estimation of the simulation model. We show that there exist solutions for both these issues. Along the way, we clarify some confounding differences in terminology between computer science and economic literature.}

  abstract={ Macroeconomic modelling has been under intense scrutiny since the Great Financial Crisis, when serious shortcomings were exposed in the methodology used to understand the economy as a whole. Criticism has been levelled at the assumptions employed in the dominant models, particularly that economic agents are homogenous and optimising and that the economy is equilibrating. In a related paper (Haldane and Turrell Oxford Rev Econ Polic 34(1–2):219–251 2018), we argue that an interdisciplinary approach to modelling in macroeconomics is beneficial. Here we focus on what one such approach - agent-based modelling, which has been extensively used across a wide range of disciplines - could do for macroeconomics. Agent-based models are complementary to existing approaches to macroeconomics and are particularly well-suited to answering questions where complexity, heterogeneity, networks, and heuristics play an important role.},

Although there were many predecessor approaches, which tried to build formal models of social systems, all of them fell short of the peculiar features of the objects of all social sciences: complex systems consisting of numerous autonomous actors who interact with each other, who take on different roles at the same time, who are conscious of their interactions and roles and who can communicate with the help of symbolic languages even about the counterfactual.},

It emerges autonomously from exchanges among selfish agents with bounded rationalities. And such emergent money collapses autonomously.

In this paper I will revisit the same topic, building a model in the same line. I discuss this problem from the viewpoint of chaotic itinerancy. Money is the most popular system for evading the difficulty of exchange under division of labor. It emerges autonomously from exchanges among selfish agents which behave as automata. And such emergent money collapses autonomously. I describe money as a structure in economic space, explaining its autonomous emergence and collapse as two phases of the same phenomenon. The key element in this phenomenon is the switch of the meaning of strategies. This is caused by the drastic change of environment caused by the emergence of a structure. This dynamics shares some aspects with chaotic itinerancy.},
