# Wealth Distribution Simulation

This project simulates the evolution of wealth and education in a population of agents over time. It models inheritance, education, interactions, and demographic processes, and provides tools for visualizing the resulting distributions.

## Features

- **Agent-based simulation** of wealth, education, and demographic changes.
- **Inheritance mechanism**: Wealth is passed to children upon death.
- **Education growth**: Agents increase their education over time, affecting their income.
- **Interactions**: Agents interact and transact wealth based on proximity and probability.
- **Demographic realism**: Agents have parents, children, and age-dependent death probability.
- **Metrics logging**: Wealth and education statistics are logged at each iteration.
- **Visualization**: Jupyter notebook for plotting Gini coefficient, wealth/education percentiles, and more.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust (edition 2021)
- Python 3 with `matplotlib` and `pandas` for visualization

### Build & Run

1. **Build the simulation:**

    ```sh
    cargo build --release
    ```

2. **Run the simulation:**

    ```sh
    cargo run --release
    ```

    By default, configuration is loaded from `config/default.json`. You can provide a custom config file as an argument.

    ```sh
    cargo run --release -- path/to/your/config.json
    ```

    If you want to run a simulation without a visualisation window, provide an environment variable `VISUALISE = false`:

    ```sh
    VISUALISE=false cargo run --release -- path/to/your/config.json
    ```

3. **View results:**cargo run --release
    - Simulation metrics are saved to `visualisation/metrics.csv`.
    - Open `visualisation/visualisation.ipynb` in Jupyter to plot and analyze results.

## Configuration

Simulation parameters are set in `config/default.json`, including:

- Number of agents
- World size
- Interaction parameters
- Tax rate
- Age and death curve parameters
- Education and wealth parameters

    "min_inheritance_at_birth_rate": 0.1,
    "max_inheritance_at_birth_rate": 0.3
  }
}
```

## Visualization

The `visualisation/visualisation.ipynb` notebook provides plots for:

- Gini coefficient over time
- Wealth percentiles over time
- Total wealth and adult agent count
- Education mean and percentiles
- Death probability curve

## File Structure

- `src/agent.rs` - Agent definition and behavior
- `src/environment.rs` - Simulation environment and logic
- `src/metrics.rs` - Logging of simulation metrics (wealth and education)
- `src/environment_config.rs` - Configuration structs and loading
- `visualisation/metrics.csv` - Output metrics for plotting
- `visualisation/visualisation.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook for analysis
